####To whom it may concern:

  When I first started learning to code in Ruby a few months ago I was surprised that, for the first time, I was excited to continue my education. Having been toying with the idea of going back to school for several years, but never sure how I would find the time. The web development course seems perfect for someone like me that does not want to spend 2 or more years in a traditional college setting (again.)

I have several reasons why I want to learn Web Development: 

* Tired of dead end jobs
* Want to have more control over who I work for
* Want to be able to take my skills to other places
* Find ways to contribute to a global community
* Make more money
* Continue my education in a field that needs more women


I have tried teaching myself, but I worry if I am up to the standards. Also I want to be able to show an employer that I have the skills. After meeting with Chris at one of the socials I am convinced that I can complete the immersion course and become a full-stack developer. 

Regardless if you enroll me, I will continue down this path. PCS would give me the confidence that I think is missing from myself study. Hopefully Iâ€™m the right fit for your classes. 

*Sincerely,* 

Andrea Moulding
